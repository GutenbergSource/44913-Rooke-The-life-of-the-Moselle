<HTML><BODY>A lovely illustrated travel-book on the river Moselle (Mosel) in France and Germany. The author followed this river from its source in France, to Coblence (Koblenz) where it joins with the river Rhine (Rhein).

<p>This book should not pose any particular difficulties, although the OCR wasn't always capable to correctly read some of the text, due to the quality of the scans. If needed, the original scans can be found here in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/lifeofmosellefro00rookuoft#page/n9/mode/2up">Internet archive</a>. A few pages have been taken from alternative scan sources, also at The Internet Archive.

<p>A few German words appear, and in those, please take care to note any diaeresis (umlauts), and add them.
